# Full-Stack-Apps
This is a repository on creating full-stack apps.
The backend was created using python , django and rest framework while the frontend created using javascript react hyml and css. 
For the backend folder you need to run the command python manage.py runserver in order to init the server.
For the frontend folder you need to run the command npm run dev in order to load the front pages. 
In this app we implement the authentication process in which the user gives us his username and password through registration. After through the backend he obtains a unique pair of tokens (ACCESS,REFRESH) the JWT TOKENS we send them in the frontend and the user can login successfully being authorized. Also he is able through his requests because he have the tokens and he is authorized to create, see and delete notes.
